# Random Forest Lab

## TODO List:

1. Study (and practice some implementations): [Understanding Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.7502) PhD dissertation, Gilles Louppe, July 2014. Defended on October 9, 2014.

2. Read and practice: [Functional Programming in Python: When and How to Use It](https://realpython.com/python-functional-programming/).

3. Implement Decision Trees from scratch. Approach to be defined.

4. Implement Random Forest from scratch. Approach to be defined.
